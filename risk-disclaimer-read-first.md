# âš  Risk Disclaimer READ FIRST

Managing your risk is an important key when using decentralized finance. All information here should be independently verified, researched, and confirmed. We hope that the value the Protocol brings will be reflected in the value of the token; however, we cannot guarantee anything with respect to the token price, as there are many factors that we cannot control.&#x20;

The Reverse Protocol and its team are not responsible for any losses or changes in token price and are not responsible for any lost funds due to smart contract exploits or otherwise. Reverse Protocol is also not responsible for any loss of funds or loss of value using any of its features.&#x20;

The Reverse Protocol does not entitle users to any profit or revenue of any kind and RVRS should be considered an experiment, rather than an investment.&#x20;



**Never risk more than you can lose - you alone are responsible for your choices.**
