# ‚ùì FAQ

## **Where can I buy RVRS Tokens?**

RVRS is not currently traded on any networks. The only way to obtain RVRS is to bond funds with the Reverseum Treasury during an active bonding event, which will be announced on [Discord ](https://discord.gg/C5YqrQEjdX)and Twitter when they are happening.

## **Can I stake and forget?**

It's even easier than that right now with RVRS. There is no staking! Simply holding your tokens in your wallet on Arbitrum will qualify you for voting and distribution privileges at this time.

## **How secure is Reverse Protocol?**

Our protocol is as secure as the Arbitrum Network is, as it houses our governance token. Our investments are spread out across multiple chains, so there are additional risk factors associated with each of these investments.

## **How does the treasury earn yield?**

The Reverseum Treasury puts most of its liquidity to work, creating more value than a dormant treasury can.

## **Why not mirror RVRS investments yourself?**

The RVRS treasury is invested in numerous strategies; many of these strategies require more complex management than the average investor is ready to tackle. We also have efficiencies of scale operating on high-gas networks, which provides significant savings when spread to all the different investors. RVRS is one simple investment on a fast and affordable network, and managing your portfolio is as easy as holding the tokens in your wallet. Participation in Governance on Discord provides investors a voice in how the treasury is managed, as well as opportunities to get involved as a contributor to earn rewards. This builds not only knowledge and skills, but also reputation and exposure to the builder side of the Crypto Narrative.
