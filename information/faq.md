# ‚ùì FAQ

## Is Reverse an OHM Fork?

Reverse is not an OHM fork, it is inspired by its mechanics but uses a different Bonding strategy (Bonding Pools), does not aspire to be a Reserve Currency and does not rebase. Read more on the differences [<mark style="color:red;">**here**</mark>](../the-protocol/ohm-vs.-reverse.md)**.**

## <mark style="color:red;">I lost money on a Bonding Pool eventhough the current NET ROI was positive?</mark>

Huge price fluctuations will impact the NET ROI of Bonding Pools. This is not different than how Reserve Currency projects like Wonderland work. More information can be found [<mark style="color:red;">**here**</mark>](../the-protocol/reverseum-bonding-pools.md).

## How does Current NET ROI work?

The current NET ROI is the expected return on investment for the remaining duration of a Bond. Our Bonding Pools incentivize getting in early, so make sure you check our Discord if you want to participate in a new Bonding Pool as we will always announce these beforehand.

## Can I stake and forget?

We want the "stake and forget" approach to be as sustainable as it is with an OHM fork and want to utilize the treasury yields in the benefit of RVRS holders because of that. Although in the true spirit of a DAO we want our community proposals to manage the treasury. The proposals might sometimes mean the staking rewards may fall short when compared to Bonding Pool rewards, we will adjust yields when this happens to make staking more attractive.

## What is APY?

Annual percentage yield is a normalised representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period of one year. APY figures allow for a reasonable, single-point comparison of different offerings with varying compounding schedules.

## How secure is Reverse Protocol?

All our contracts are inspired by battle-tested and audited contracts used by different protocols. We are still working to get additional audits completed for extra security measures.



## How does the treasury earn yield?

The Reverseum Treasury puts most of its liquidity to work, creating more value than a dormant treasury can. The Reverseum Treasury can act as a Decentralized Venture Capital thanks to this approach. Details on said strategies can be found [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ocl8Gx8rA4Zbzcsxb8-EuFNEQNlTsMLsMMRazixz\_gk/edit#gid=0).
