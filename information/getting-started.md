Step 1: [**Setting up Metamask**](https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-harmony-one-4fe67c6d1026)****

Connect your metamask to [**bridge.harmony.one**](https://bridge.harmony.one/busd) and use your wallet address, once you see your wallet address copy that and paste it on [**explorer.harmony.one**](https://explorer.harmony.one) and you will get your Harmony One wallet address starting with "one". Copy this address and save it, it will be your metamask wallet address.&#x20;

Go to binance or kucoin, buy some ONE and withdraw it on your address and remember to select network as Harmony or ONE. On kucoin you can send a minimum of 20 ONE and on Binance you can send a minimum of 60 ONE.&#x20;

Once you send your ONES to your metamask open **** [**app.sushi.com**](https://app.sushi.com/swap) you will see your ONE coins over there.

Copy the contract address of REVERSE PROTOCOL (0xed0b4b0f0e2c17646682fc98ace09feb99af3ade) and PASTE it into import tokens on sushiswap. You will see RVRS. Import that token and buy from ONE/RVRS.&#x20;
