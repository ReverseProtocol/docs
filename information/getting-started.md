1. [**Setting up Metamask**](https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-harmony-one-4fe67c6d1026)
2. Connect your Metamask to [**Synapse Bridge**](https://synapseprotocol.com/?inputCurrency=USDC\&outputCurrency=USDC\&outputChain=1)****
3. Navigate to the "Bridge" tab in the Synapse app
4. Select the network that you wish to transfer funds out of using the "From" dropdown menu (if necessary, accept the request in your wallet to switch networks to that chain)
5. Select the assets that you wish to bridge from the dropdown menu to the right of the input field (stablecoins, ETH, or SYN, plus an expanding list of tokens from partnerships)
6. Select 'HarmonyONE' as destination chain from the "To" dropdown menu.
7. Input the amount that you would like to transfer into the number field
8. Make sure that the amount you will be receiving appears correct, and click "Approve Token" to grant Synapse approval to spend the stablecoin you are swapping _(Note: you will receive the indicated amount of the native token when bridging to a non-Ethereum chain, enough to allow you to make 1-2 swaps upon arrival.)_
9. Click "Bridge Token" after the approval has been confirmed to bridge your funds.
