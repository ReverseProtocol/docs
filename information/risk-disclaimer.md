# âš  Risk Disclaimer

Managing your risk is an important key when using decentralized finance. All information here should be independently verified, researched, and confirmed. We, as the founding team, hope that the value the Protocol brings will be reflected in the value of the token; however, we cannot guarantee anything with respect to the token price, as there are many factors that we cannot control.&#x20;

The Reverse Protocol and its team are not responsible for any losses or changes in token price and are not responsible for any lost funds due to smart contract exploits. The Reverse Protocol does not entitle users to any profit or revenue and should be considered an experiment, rather than an investment.
