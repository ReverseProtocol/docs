# Launch Procedure

## About the IDO

The RVRS token sale will take place on the Artemis Protocol Launchpad, namely, the ArtemisPad, and will be open to the general public.

**From Artemis' documentation:** _"The token sale system follows an overflow sales method, in which users can subscribe as much or as little as they want to the token sale, and their final allocation will be based on the amount of funds they put in as a percentage of all funds put in by other users at the time the sale ends. Users will receive back any leftover funds when they claim their tokens after the sale. In the case all the funds targeted aren't raised, the sale will proceed as normal, and all funds contributed will be spent."_

A total of **1,000,000 RVRS** Tokens will be for sale, aiming to raise **\~$455,000** in ONE tokens._ _15% of the ONE raised will be allocated to the Artemis Treasury, while 70% will be paired to RVRS tokens on liquidity launch, and 15% will be used to cover Reverse's development costs and future audits.
