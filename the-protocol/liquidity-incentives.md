# Liquidity Incentives

Although Reverse's end game is for the Reverseum decentralized Treasury to control most of the RVRS's liquidity through Governance, incentivizing liquidity providing is a proven way to attract users to Defi applications in their infancy, Reverse applies this strategy by rewarding providers in RVRS tokens. The game theory of liquidity incentives is that users would enter these liquidity positions , and build it until a new Reverseum Pools with these go live, at this point, users would give these liquidity assets to the protocol to capture a higher share of the RVRS distribution.

Contrary to other yield-generating Defi, the Reverse Protocol will dynamically manage its RVRS minting emissions to sustain high annual returns for its liquidity providers while expanding supply and distributing RVRS in a consistent manner. If these rates fall below a certain threshold, there will be a rebase to ensure a reliable high yield. Bear in mind that the protocol aims to incentivize the use of bonding pools, and thus, these will always have considerably higher returns than liquidity pools.&#x20;
