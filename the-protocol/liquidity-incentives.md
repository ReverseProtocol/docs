# Liquidity Incentives

Although Reverse's end game is for the Reverseum decentralized Treasury to control most of the RVRS's liquidity through Governance and its DAO, incentivizing liquidity providing is a proven way to attract users to Defi applications in their infancy, Reverse applies this strategy by rewarding providers in RVRS tokens.&#x20;

Contrary to other yield-generating Defi, the Reverse Protocol will dynamically manage its RVRS minting emissions to sustain high annual returns for its liquidity providers while expanding supply and distributing RVRS in a consistent manner. If these rates fall below a certain threshold, there will be a rebase to ensure a reliable high yield. Bear in mind that the protocol aims to incentivize the use of bonding pools, and thus, these will always have considerably higher returns than liquidity pools.&#x20;

Upon launch, the following liquidity pools will reward users in RVRS.

| Liquidity Pool | Rewards Allocation |
| :------------: | :----------------: |
|   RVRS - ONE   |         70%        |
|   RVRS - UST   |         10%        |
|   RVRS - MIS   |         10%        |
|  RVRS - COINK  |         10%        |

&#x20;As the protocol grows, we plan on launching the following strategic pools.

|                Upcoming Reverse Pools                |
| :--------------------------------------------------: |
| RVRS - wsOHM (Wrapped, Staked OHM that earns Rebase) |
|               RVRS - SPELL & RVRS - MIM              |
