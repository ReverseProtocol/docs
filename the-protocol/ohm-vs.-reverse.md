# ðŸ”€ OHM vs. Reverse

As we've outlined already, Reverse is not an OlympusDAO fork; however, it is inspired and takes cues from OHM, specifically from its protocol-owned liquidity and bonding mechanics.

## The differences

OHM functions as a reserve currency, and more recently, also as a bonds marketplace. OHM at the moment periodically rebases at a set rate in a set interval. RVRS on the other hand is a treasury management and yield generating protocol, inspired by the Olympus DAO.&#x20;

The RVRS token does not rebase - it is rewarded for taking part in the liquidity incentives and bonding pools programs, as well being minted by RVRS stakers, and is used as a key for governance and treasury management as well as the way to access treasury rewards.&#x20;

The Reverse treasury, dubbed Reverseum, will not be used to directly back RVRS tokens at a risk free value (RFV) like OHM, but will instead be used more aggressively to generate and distribute yield and incentives to RVRS holders, although these strategies are for governance to decide.

## The similarities

RVRS uses a mechanic called bonding pools, which is inspired by OHM's bonding. In bonding pools, similar to how OHM uses bonds to incentivize permanent liquidity and grow its treasury, users forfeit their assets in hope of a higher ROI.&#x20;

We have also taken inspiration in the way OHM rebases and are applying this effect to Reverse by re-adjusting liquidity pool APYs, should they drop below a threshold that makes them unattractive, perpetually incentivizing contribution.
