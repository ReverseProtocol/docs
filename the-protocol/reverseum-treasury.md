# üè¶ Reverseum Treasury

Yield generated from the governance controlled investments is accumulated and used for distributing profit to RVRS stakers; compounding back into investments; and buybacks (depending on market conditions). Each week all RVRS stakers will receive an even proportion of that week's profits, as determined by governance, in the form of UST.\

This is one of the unique features of RVRS that adds particular value to holding and staking RVRS. Profits are paid out weekly in the form of a stablecoin that can be used to DCA back into the protocol through bonding; buying more RVRS direct from the market; or taken as profit. All without creating any sell pressure for the protocol.\
