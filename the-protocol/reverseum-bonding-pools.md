# ðŸ”“ Bonding Pools

When leveraging the power of Bonding Pools, users forfeit either their liquidity pool assets (e.g., RVRS - ONE), or single assets (e.g., UST) and give these to the protocol's Treasury. In return, bonders will capture a higher share of the RVRS distribution.&#x20;

Bonding Pools allow Reverse to acquire its own liquidity and other reserve assets, stored in the Reverseum Treasury, which is managed by the RVRS Governance.&#x20;

This model ensures two things: firstly, there is at any point in time, locked exit liquidity in the trading pools to facilitate market operations and protect token holders and long-term liquidity providers; secondly, the protocol will count with liquid single assets in the form of stablecoins that can be managed to deploy a large range on strategies to both benefit stakers and expand the treasury.

In the case of liquidity provider tokens: 50% of the bonded assets will be burned, ensuring permanent liquidity for said pair, and 50% will flow into the Reverseum Treasury.&#x20;

In the case of single assets such as UST or DAI: 100% of it will flow into the Reverseum Treasury and be used to benefit RVRS holders, stakers, and liquidity providers. Liquidity-based Bonding Pools intend for RVRS emissions to be offset by the RVRS being burned, as long as `APY Bonding Pools >> APY Liquidity Pools`, this should be the case.



To sum up **BONDING POOLS** more practically:

* You **GIVE UP** your assets (currently RVRS/ONE or UST) to the protocol. The assets are partly burned and will partly be managed and eventually **DISTRIBUTED** to RVRS holders.&#x20;
* In return, you are being paid out a token share depending on how much assets you bonded in relation to the total assets bonded and how much incentives are left in the bonding pool, these tokens are distributed to you over a **global period** which ticks down for everyone equally until the bonding pool is over, i.e. the rewards are vested over a set period of time.
* Bonding Pools do **NOT** guarantee you return nor lock in any APR or return, you are basically betting on a neutral or positive price action in order to profit over the "vesting" period in which your RVRS tokens are being paid out to you. This is the **same principle** as OHM or any of its forks, just executed differently - instead of a price discount like on OHM, you get a **surplus of yield** which, at the time of bonding could be of higher value than the assets you gave up. In both cases you are betting on a neutral or positive price action in order to profit, and are being granularly distributed tokens to!
* Bonding pools represent a higher-risk higher-return way to earn yield on Reverse, which also feeds back positively into the protocol. It doesn't guarantee a return and market sentiment and demand regulates their effectiveness
