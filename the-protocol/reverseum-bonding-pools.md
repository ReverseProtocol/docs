# ðŸ”“ Bonding Pools

Reverseâ€™s bonding pools are designed to do two things:\
\
**Regular Bonding**: Grow the Reverse treasury and to reward bonders with the chance to acquire RVRS at a discount to market price.\
_`Stablecoin in->RVRS token out`_

**RVRS Bonding:** Allow RVRS holders to cash out their share of the Treasury by exchanging RVRS for treasury assets at a rate set by Governance.\
_`RVRS token in->Stablecoin out`_

Using the bonding pools means <mark style="color:red;">permanently forfeiting</mark> assets to exchange with the treasury for the desired asset at the agreed upon rate. This is not reversible!\


The act of bonding assets in and out of the treasury give the community more control over the assets controlled by the Protocol. No longer will Macro Market effects dilute hodlers by dumping the price of RVRS. Nor will moonshot boyz pump and dump the price, wrecking investors.\
\
**Further details about Bonding Pools will be released as we update the protocol to enable new bonding pool designs.**\
