# ðŸ”“ Bonding Pools

Reverseâ€™s bonding pools are designed to grow the Reverse treasury and to reward bonders with the chance to acquire RVRS at a discount to market price.\


Using the bonding pools means <mark style="color:red;">permanently forfeiting</mark> assets to the treasury in exchange for a share of the emissions of the bonding pool each block.\


The act of bonding is great for the protocol and for stakers as it builds the treasury. Bonding can also be great for the bonders as it may provide an opportunity to acquire RVRS below market price, during the right market conditions.\


### **Mechanics** 

Bonders permanently forfeit their assets to the Reverse Treasury in order to get access to the RVRS bonding pools emissions. The Reverse Bonding pools emit RVRS each block whilst the bonding pool is in active rewards mode and this is at a set rate for each bonding pool. The bonders are rewarded with RVRS, distributed proportionately each block, based on the user's share of the total assets in the bond pool.\


This continues for the duration of the bond pool.\


### **How is ROI determined** 

The Reverse Bonding Pools have a set RVRS emission each block and a set number of blocks for the pool. This creates a total pool of RVRS to be distributed by the bonding pool. The Reverse Bonding Pools do not set a discount or ROI â€” they only set emissions per block and how many blocks.\


The market, by bonding to the pool, determines the total value of assets forfeited.\


Thus the total value of assets forfeited, divided by the RVRS emitted by the pool determines the rewards for the bond pool based on ($ forfeited)/(RVRS earned).\


Comparing this to the current market price of RVRS determines the ROI.\


<mark style="color:red;">**Be Aware:**</mark>** ** It is important to note that when you bond, the ROI displayed is not necessarily your achieved ROI across the duration of the pool, as your share of the pool at each block determines your distribution at each block. It is not like Ohm pools where you lock in a discount â€” the ROI can and will vary by additional funds being bonded or by the price of RVRS changing during the pool distribution.\


### **How does it benefit bonders** 

Bonders are able to get RVRS at a discount compared to buying on market. This also grows the treasury which means the RVRS that bonders receive from bonding becomes more valuable. Where the discount occurs is when the $/RVRS in the bond pool is less than the market price of RVRS and this is where the value for bonders comes from. The fewer assets forfeited to the pool, the higher the achieved discount â€” however, if the discount is too high, people are likely to bond more, which in turn reduces the discount. This mechanism will control itself based on market sentiment and willing capital to bond for RVRS.\


At the other end of the spectrum, it is unlikely that the discount should go negative. The emissions per block is set and there is a market price for RVRS, this determines the upper limit on how much capital can be bonded to the pool â€” as otherwise the $/RVRS in the bonding pool is greater than the market price ($/RVRS).\


This is unlikely to occur, as every bonder would make a loss if this was the case. A bad actor (eg. uninformed investor) is unable to push the pool negative without incurring the same loss as the rest of the pool. Once the pool has reached the threshold set by community governance, it will be closed on the UI. The final deposit could, however, push it negative if it is large enough, as the bond contract does not have a hard cap built in.\
