# OHM and Reverse - How do they differ?

As we've outlined already, Reverse is not an OlympusDAO fork - it is inspired and takes cues from OHM's mechanics, but can in no way be considered an OHM fork.

## The differences

**OHM** functions as a reserve currency and more recently also as a bonds marketplace. OHM at the moment periodically rebases at a set rate in an set interval.&#x20;

**RVRS** on the other hand is a treasury management, yield generating protocol taking inspiration from OHM-like mechanics.

Reverse RVRS token does NOT rebase - it is rewarded for taking part in liquidity and bonding pools, and used as a key for governance and treasury management as well as treasury rewards.&#x20;

The Reverse treasury, dubbed Reverseum, will not be used to directly back RVRS tokens at a risk free value (RFV) like OHM, but will instead be used more aggressively to generate and distribute yield and incentives to RVRS holders.

## The similarities

RVRS uses a mechanic called bonding pools, which is inspired by OHM's bonding. In bonding pools, similar to how OHM uses bonds to incentivize permanent liquidity and grow its treasury.

We have taken inspiration in the way OHM rebases and are applying this effect to Reverse by re-adjusting liquidity pool APRs, should they drop below a threshold that makes them unattractive, perpetually incentivizing contribution.
