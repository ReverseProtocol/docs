# ðŸ”€ OHM vs. Reverse

As we've outlined already, Reverse is not an OlympusDAO fork; however, it is inspired by and takes cues from OHM, specifically from its protocol-owned liquidity and bonding mechanics.\


The differences\



OHM functions as a reserve currency, and more recently, as a bonds marketplace. OHM at the moment rebases at a set rate in a set interval. RVRS on the other hand is a treasury management and yield generating protocol, inspired by the treasury growth mechanisms of Olympus DAO.\


The RVRS token does not rebase - it is rewarded for taking part in the bonding pools programs, as well being minted by RVRS stakers, and is used as a key for governance and treasury management as well as the way to access treasury rewards.\


The Reverse treasury, dubbed Reverseum, will not be used to directly back RVRS tokens at a risk free value (RFV) like OHM, but will instead be used more aggressively to generate and distribute yield and incentives to RVRS holders, although these strategies are for governance to decide. Instead of RFV, RVRS has several mechanisms to adjust protocol activity based on market activity. The Treasury buys back tokens based on an algorithm approved by the community, so when the price of RVRS is below the treasury value, RVRS will be returned to the Reverseum to be used later as bonding incentives after the price has recovered, thus growing the value of the treasury and letting the market price adjust accordingly. This is different than a buyback-and-burn strategy, as that can only influence price through token scarcity. RVRS, on the other hand, influences price through providing realizable value to stakers. This means buybacks are not exit-liquidity for RVRS holders, as the value isn't burnt. It's held by the treasury to be redeployed at a profit through bonding at a later time.\


The similarities\



RVRS uses a mechanic called bonding pools, which is inspired by OHM's bonding. In bonding pools, similar to how OHM uses bonds to incentivize permanent liquidity and grow its treasury, users forfeit their assets in hope of a higher ROI. Along with that we have protocol owned liquidity and a treasury of assets. The similarities end there!\
