# ðŸ”€ OHM vs. Reverse

As we've outlined already, Reverse is not an OlympusDAO fork; however, it is inspired by and takes cues from OHM, specifically from its protocol-owned liquidity and bonding mechanics.\


The differences\



OHM functions as a reserve currency, and more recently, as a bonds marketplace. OHM at the moment rebases at a set rate in a set interval. RVRS on the other hand is a treasury management and yield generating protocol, inspired by the treasury growth mechanisms of Olympus DAO.\


The RVRS token does not rebase - it is rewarded for taking part in the bonding pools programs and is used as a key for governance and treasury management as well as the way to access treasury rewards.\


The Reverse treasury, dubbed Reverseum, will not be used to directly back RVRS tokens at a risk free value (RFV) like OHM, but will instead be used more aggressively to generate and distribute yield and incentives to RVRS holders; these strategies are for governance to decide. Instead of RFV, RVRS will host occasional 'Reverse Bonds' which will allow RVRS holders to cash out their RVRS at a rate agreed upon by the community.\


The similarities\



RVRS uses a mechanic called bonding pools, which is inspired by OHM's bonding. In bonding pools, similar to how OHM uses bonds to incentivize permanent liquidity and grow its treasury, users forfeit their assets in hope of a higher ROI. We don't, however, have dynamic bond pricing that reflects ever-changing market prices. The RVRS token has no official liquidity on any exchanges, so it cannot be freely traded.\

In essence RVRS is now more aligned with the [MolochDAO](https://medium.com/raid-guild/moloch-evolved-v2-primer-25c9cdeab455) framework.\
