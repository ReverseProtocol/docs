# Bonding Pools vs Bonding

To sum up **BONDING POOLS** more practically:

* &#x20;You **GIVE UP** your assets (currently RVRS/ONE or UST) to the protocol. The assets are partly burned and will partly be managed and eventually **DISTRIBUTED **to RVRS holders.&#x20;
* In return, you are being paid out a token share depending on how much assets you bonded in relation to the total assets bonded and how much incentives are left in the bonding pool, these tokens are distributed to you over a **global period** which ticks down for everyone equally until the bonding pool is over.
* Bonding does **NOT** guarantee you return nor lock in any APR or return, you are basically betting on a neutral or positive price action in order to profit over the "vesting" period in which your RVRS tokens are being paid out to you. This is the** same principle **as OHM or any of its forks, just executed differently - instead of a price discount like on OHM, you get a **surplus of yield** which, at the time of bonding could be of higher value than the assets you gave up. In both cases you are betting on a neutral or positive price action in order to profit, and are being granularly distributed tokens to!
* Bonding pools represent a higher-risk higher-return way to earn yield on Reverse, which also feeds back positively into the protocol. It doesn't guarantee a return and market sentiment and demand regulates their effectiveness
