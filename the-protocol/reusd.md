# reUSD

..._Inspired by Frax, the worldâ€™s first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin._

The Reverse USD (reUSD) will be a permissionless, decentralized, and partially collateralized stablecoin backed by RVRS tokens. It is set to launch in the coming months and its contracts will be fully audited and heavily pen-tested before it officially launches on Harmony Mainnet.

The reUSD will be the peak of Reverse as a self-governed decentralized currency protocol and is set to completely change how the DAO operates.
