# ðŸ™‹â™€ ðŸ™‹â™€ Governance

Governance is an integral part of Reverse Protocol. $RVRS holders get to vote on proposals concerning the protocol and treasury. When making a proposal, contributors include as much information as possible and give voters a list of pros and cons; everyone is encouraged to take part in governance discussions on our [**Discord Server**](https://discord.com/invite/reverseprotocol), regardless of investing experience.\


Treasury strategies\



The unique benefit of Reverse Protocol vs. other treasury protocols is the yield earning strategies the Reverseum Treasury utilizes. The treasury is our war chest and we use it to earn yield on countless different chains with different strategies. These strategies are currently outlined in [**Here** ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNsmVWqtPrtZr7z4i2n1ZgRNAEZdX3coPzMbZNPCZ34/edit#gid=563760963)and shared on our [**Discord Server**](https://discord.com/invite/reverseprotocol).\


The community is actively engaged in determining the best strategies for investment, and investment allocation and balancing is constantly being adjusted to accommodate market conditions. The more investors brought into the community, the more aware and responsive the treasury becomes.\
