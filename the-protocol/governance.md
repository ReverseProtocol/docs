# ðŸ™‹â™€ Governance

Governance is an integral part of Reverse Protocol. $RVRS holders get to vote on proposals concerning the protocol and treasury put up by the team until a DAO is fully functional.

When making a proposal we will include as much information as possible and give voters a list of pros and cons; but we still encourage everyone to take part in governance discussions on our [**Discord Server**](https://discord.com/invite/reverseprotocol)**.**

## Governance Council

The governance council will act as an important part of the DAO efforts and will review governance proposals before they get put up for a vote.&#x20;

The council doesn't have more voting power. It's a voluntary role that helps organize proposals before they get put up for a vote.

## Treasury strategies

The unique benefit of Reverse Protocol vs. OHM-forks is the yield earning strategies the Reverseum Treasury utilizes.&#x20;

Our treasury is our war chest and we can use it to earn yield on countless different chains with different strategies.

These strategies are currently outlined in [**Here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ocl8Gx8rA4Zbzcsxb8-EuFNEQNlTsMLsMMRazixz\_gk/edit#gid=0) **** and shared on our [**Discord Server**](https://discord.com/invite/reverseprotocol).
