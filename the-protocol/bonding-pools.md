# Bonding Pools

When leveraging the power of Bonding Pools, users forfeit either their liquidity pool assets (e.g., RVRS - ONE), or single assets (e.g., UST) and give these to the protocol's Treasury, in return, bonders will capture a higher share of the RVRS distribution.&#x20;

Bonding Pools allow Reverse to acquire its own liquidity and other reserve assets, stored in the Reverseum Treasury, which is managed by the RVRS Governance. This model ensures two things: firstly, there is at any point in time, locked exit liquidity in the trading pools to facilitate market operations and protect token holders and long-term liquidity providers; secondly, the protocol will count with liquid single assets in the form of stablecoins that can be managed to deploy a large range on strategies.

In the case of liquidity provider tokens: 75% of the bonded assets will be burned, ensuring permanent liquidity for said pair, and 25% will flow into the Reverseum Treasury. In the case of single assets such as UST or DAI: 100% of it will flow into the Reverseum Treasury and be used to benefit RVRS holders, stakers, and liquidity providers. Liquidity-based Bonding Pools intend for RVRS emissions to be offset by the RVRS being burned, as long as `APY Bonding Pools >> APY Liquidity Pools`, this should be the case. Upon launch, the following bonding pools will be available.

|     Pool     | RVRS Allocated |
| :----------: | :------------: |
|  RVRS - ONE  |    3,500,000   |
|      UST     |     500,000    |
|  RVRS - MIS  |     500,000    |
| RVRS - COINK |     500,000    |
