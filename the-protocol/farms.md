# ðŸ‘©ðŸŒ¾ Farms

## Why have farms on an OHM-esque protocol?

The benefit of farms to the Reverse Protocol is to provide initial liquidity while the bonds can start earning yield and applying Reverseum Treasury's strategies immediately.&#x20;

Unlike other OHM inspired projects Reverse actively uses it's treasury to earn yield instead of purely just backing the RVRS token with it, providing the returns to $RVRS stakers.The farms initially help this process by freeing up the bonded RVRS-ONE and RVRS-UST pools.&#x20;

Despite this, the Reverse Farms are designed to be slowly phased out of the protocol over time with the addition of new bonding pools. The plan to phase them out involves cutting emissions over time and removing them completely once enough liquidity bonding pools have been added.

Our protocol is focused on it's **Treasury** and **Staking** first and foremost and Farms are a tool to bolster the **Treasury**. While in the short term farms help free up our treasury, in the long term they become a less necessary part of our model and we don't need to incentivize them. For this reason we have done two cuts to the Farms so far that both have significantly reduced their reward allocation (%50, %70) and will over time keep reducing it until it reaches 0.&#x20;
