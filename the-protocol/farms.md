# ðŸ‘©ðŸŒ¾ Farms

Farms benefit bonders and stakers indirectly through freeing up locked liquidity. **The focus of Reverse Protocol is first and foremost it's treasury. **Farms help enable the treasury funds to partake in yield earning strategies and free them up to be burned. Farms also act as an extra incentive for users that don't want to lock their liquidity, although they will mainly be benefiting users that choose to bond & stake.

**The farms are designed in a way that will disincentivize selling and their main purpose is to benefit both bonders and stakers as farms themselves have a much lower emission allocation compared to  bonds and staking. The advantage of farming for the user's perspective is having the option to not lock your liquidity. **

Contrary to other yield-generating Defi, the Reverse Protocol will dynamically manage its RVRS minting emissions to sustain high annual returns for its liquidity providers while expanding supply and distributing RVRS in a consistent manner. If these rates fall below a certain threshold, there will be a rebase to ensure a reliable high yield. **Bear in mind that the protocol aims to incentivize the use of bonding pools, and thus, these will always have considerably higher returns than liquidity pools. **
