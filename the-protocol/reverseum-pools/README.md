# Reverseum Pools

When leveraging the power of Reverseum Pools, users forfeit either their liquidity pool assets (e.g., RVRS - ONE), or single assets (e.g., UST) and give these to the protocol's Treasury, in return, bonders will capture a higher share of the RVRS distribution.&#x20;

Bonding Pools allow Reverse to acquire its own liquidity and other reserve assets, stored in the Reverseum Treasury, which is managed by the RVRS Governance. This model ensures two things: firstly, there is at any point in time, locked exit liquidity in the trading pools to facilitate market operations and protect token holders and long-term liquidity providers; secondly, the protocol will count with liquid single assets in the form of stablecoins that can be managed to deploy a large range on strategies to both benefit stakers and expand the treasury.

In the case of liquidity provider tokens: 50% of the bonded assets will be burned, ensuring permanent liquidity for said pair, and 50% will flow into the Reverseum Treasury. In the case of single assets such as UST or DAI: 100% of it will flow into the Reverseum Treasury and be used to benefit RVRS holders, stakers, and liquidity providers. Liquidity-based Bonding Pools intend for RVRS emissions to be offset by the RVRS being burned, as long as `APY Bonding Pools >> APY Liquidity Pools`, this should be the case.
