# ‚ôê $RVRS

The Reverse Token (RVRS) composes the fundamental building blocks of the Reverse Protocol.&#x20;

It is used to capture and earn yield via auto-compounding RVRS staking, liquidity incentives and reverseum pools, being the yield-bearing token for any asset distributed from the treasury (e.g., earning DAI through RVRS staking), as well as being the core of the protocol's Governance and Reverseum Treasury management, which as strategies are deployed, intends to support the RVRS currency.&#x20;

By focusing on stable supply growth through minting and on building permanent liquidity and a basket of assets managed by the protocol's governance, rather than price appreciation, Reverse aims for RVRS to become the leading decentralized currency on Harmony.&#x20;

## Supply Distribution

RVRS has a hard cap of 500,000,000 tokens, of which 7,025,000 RVRS will be pre-minted, distributed as follows,

* **1,000,000 RVRS:** Allocated to the IDO on the Artemis Protocol.
* **700,000 RVRS:** Allocated for initial liquidity. 75% of these liquidity tokens will be sent to a dead address, locking permanent liquidity, while 25% will flow to the Reverseum Treasury.&#x20;
* **225,000 RVRS:** Allocated for bounties and hours for the founding team based on their work towards launch.
* **100,000 RVRS:** Allocated to the Reverseum multi-sig Treasury (4 signers). This multi-sig vault will grow in both liquidity and single assets as Reverse's products go live.
* **(Non-Circulating) 5,000,000 RVRS:** Allocated to the Bonding Pools Smart contract addresses to distribute RVRS rewards. As these are non-circulating tokens until distributed, they will not count on Market Cap calculations.
