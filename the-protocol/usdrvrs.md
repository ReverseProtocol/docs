# ♐ $RVRS Tokenomics

The Reverse Token (RVRS) is the key to accessing the benefits of Reverse Protocol.

Each RVRS token represents a share of the Reverseum Treasury, which is a community governed treasury representing a basket of assets earning yield on DeFi.

Staking RVRS in the single staking contract grants stakers access to the treasury yield distributions and to a share of RVRS emissions. This will will soon be updated with the veRVRS staking contract after the upcoming launch of veRVRS.

RVRS staking in the veRVRS contract will also entitle stakers to veRVRS, which will act as both the governance token for the protocol and also as a yield boost for staking.

Creating value to reward stakers of the RVRS token is core to the principles on which Reverse Protocol is built.\


### **Initial Supply Distribution**

\
RVRS has a hard cap of 500,000,000 tokens, of which 7,025,000 RVRS will be pre-minted and distributed as follows

* 1,000,000 RVRS: Allocated to the IDO on Artemis Protocol.
* 700,000 RVRS: Allocated for initial liquidity. 75% LP tokens burnt to guarantee liquidity, 25% held in multisig.
* 225,000 RVRS: Allocated to team at launch. 75k was returned to the multisig.
* 100,000 RVRS: Allocated to the multisig.
* &#x20;5,000,000 RVRS: Allocated to initial bonding pools – initially held in multisig. \


### Ongoing Supply&#x20;

Apart from the initial supply, the remaining RVRS are all allocated to the masterchef and will be rewarded to RVRS stakers.&#x20;

6% of all emissions are reserved for the team. 4% is reserved for protocol costs, including marketing, partnerships, incentives, expenses and bounties. These are both managed through the multisig. \
\
The ongoing emission rate of RVRS is controlled by governance and is currently set to be reduced by 25% every 3 months until 2025.\
