# ♐ $RVRS Tokenomics

The Reverse Token (RVRS) is the key to accessing the benefits of Reverse Protocol.

Each RVRS token represents a share of the Reverseum Treasury, which is a community governed treasury representing a basket of assets earning yield on DeFi.

Since there are no current emissions, there is no need for a staking contract at this time. In the future there may be a contract implemented to manage distribution rewards.

Creating value to reward holders of the RVRS token is core to the principles on which Reverse Protocol is built.\
