# ♐ $RVRS Tokenomics

The Reverse Token (RVRS) is the key to accessing the benefits of Reverse Protocol.

Each RVRS token represents a share of the Reverseum Treasury, which is a community governed treasury representing a basket of assets earning yield on DeFi.

Staking RVRS in the single staking contract grants stakers access to the UST treasury yield distributions and to a share of RVRS emissions. However this will transfer to the veRVRS staking contract with the upcoming launch of veRVRS, staking RVRS in the veRVRS staking contract&#x20;

RVRS staking will also entitle stakers to veRVRS, which acts as both the governance token for the protocol and also as a yield boost for staking.

Creating value to reward stakers of the RVRS token is core to the principles on which Reverse Protocol is built.\


## **Supply Distribution**

\
RVRS has a hard cap of 500,000,000 tokens, of which 7,025,000 RVRS will be pre-minted and distributed as follows

* 1,000,000 RVRS: Allocated to the IDO on Artemis Protocol.
* 700,000 RVRS: Allocated for initial liquidity. 75% LP tokens burnt to guarantee liquidity, 25% held in multisig.
* 225,000 RVRS: Allocated to team at launch. 75k was returned to the multisig.
* 100,000 RVRS: Allocated to the multisig.
* &#x20;5,000,000 RVRS: Allocated to initial bonding pools – initially held in multisig. \


6% of all emissions are reserved for the team. 4% is reserved for protocol costs, including marketing, partnerships, incentives, expenses and bounties. These are both managed through the multisig. \


The ongoing emissions of RVRS is controlled by governance and is currently set to reduced by 25% every 3 months until 2025.\
