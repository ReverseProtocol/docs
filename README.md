# ‚Üó Introduction

## <mark style="color:blue;">What is Reverse?</mark>

The Reverse Protocol is an ever evolving community of crypto enthusiasts and degens looking to advance their understanding of this new digital economy.

### Early Days

Born during the early days of the Ohm-Fork craze, brought on by the success of Olympus DAO (OHM) and the game-theory inspired culture of (3,3), RVRS broke away from the trend and started something new. Instead of a simple treasury backed token, the Reverse Protocol created a treasury that was managed entirely by the Governance of token holders and invested back into the DeFi ecosystem.&#x20;

One of the first unique traits of the RVRS investment system was their concept of direct revenue share of protocol profits. Before #RealYield became the next big narrative, the RVRS community was pioneering its implementation. Over the course of the following months, the protocol issued over 500K in rewards to its token holders.

### The Crashening!

All has not gone well for the Reverse Community, however. Beyond the devastation caused by UST failing, Harmony also suffered a seemingly fatal blow to all DeFi within its ecosystem. Due to fortunate timing as well as decisive action, the protocol was able to preserve a formidable amount of Treasury value, thankfully. This was, in part, due to the nature of the cross-chain diversified investments the Protocol has made over the last year; a bullish sign for cross-chain treasury investment strategies.

During these times of great changes and hardships, one thing has continue to be proven true above all else: the real value of RVRS stems from the community that controls it. It is because of this community that Reverse functions as it does today, and it is the community that continues to push it into the future. The persistence of this community now drives it to a new home on a new chain: Arbitrum!

### Moving Forward!

Within the walls of the Reverse community resides an incubator for investment Alpha. Active members from all walks of life contribute with new project ideas, investment strategies, and rewards management techniques. The community is constantly grinding away at finding every opportunity, as well as thinking outside the box for tools we can build to fill a new product market fit.

The goal of Reverse is to create an environment for community to support community. Members rise up to the role of contributor as they work at developing their own skillsets, whether in actual coding or through other mediums such as artistic content or data/project analysis.

To achieve this goal, the community at RVRS is taking a step back from the free market trading scene, and focusing its efforts on internal reorganization. No longer will the RVRS token be traded. If you see anything out there claiming to be RVRS for sale, <mark style="color:red;">**do not buy it**</mark>! Check out the [Discord ](https://discord.gg/C5YqrQEjdX)and communicate with community leaders if you wish to participate in the project.

## üè¶<mark style="color:blue;">Reverseum Treasury</mark>

Assets forfeited through bonding are accumulated in the Reverseum Treasury for the protocol's benefit. The assets will be actively managed to maximize their efficiency by community Governance. An example of this process would be as follows:

1. A protocol's user proposes a strategy in which 10% of the treasury assets are deployed on a yield generator and the profit generated is used to support DCA'ing into Ethereum as the price recovers.
2. A discussion is generated and if the sentiment is positive, a fair and decentralized Governance proposal based on [Snapshot strategies](https://snapshot.org/#/rvrsprotocol.eth) will take place.
3. If the proposal passes, the assets of the treasury will be deployed accordingly, following the strategy of the previously approved proposal.
